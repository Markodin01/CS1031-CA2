This site was designed and developed by me, throughout the process of development I used w3schools, lectures and this YT video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw&list=LL&index=36&t=4684s).

I designed the page in a way it would be comfortable to look at and read, hence big fonts. I also used the OldLondon font in the main header as Lidzbark is an odl city and the font somewhat resembles medievil font. I included a brief history of the city as I find it particullary interesting. I also included relevent links to existing sites where it was possible.
