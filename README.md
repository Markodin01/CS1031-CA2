This site was designed and developed by me, throughout the process of development I used w3schools, lectures and this YT video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw&list=LL&index=36&t=4684s).

I designed the page in a way it would be comfortable to look at and read, hence big fonts. I also used the OldLondon font in the main header as Lidzbark is an odl city and the font somewhat resembles medievil font. I included a brief history of the city as I find it particullary interesting. I also included relevent links to existing sites where it was possible, including navbar. I also added a card panel with interesing places one me visit while being in Lidzbark.

Regarding the challenges I came across. At the very top there is a small white gap I could not get rid of, no matter how I tried to work around it. I have also been troubled by the navbar itself, as while opening it the contents of the page would overlay the navbar. Also, managing the whole page with the css file was also troublesome, as it required a lot of code to align some objects properly.
